# DigitGAN: Generating images using DCGAN on MNIST handwritten digits
Welcome to DigitGAN, a hands-on project focused on generating images using a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) on the MNIST handwritten digits dataset. This project uses PyTorch to implement and train the GAN, allowing for the generation of new, realistic-looking handwritten digits.

Project Overview
The project is divided into the following tasks:

1. Setup Google Runtime: Configuring the Google Colab environment for running the project.
2. Configurations: Setting up the necessary configurations for the GAN model and training process.
3. Load MNIST Handwritten Dataset: Downloading and preparing the MNIST dataset.
4. Load Dataset into Batches: Organizing the dataset into batches for training.
5. Create Discriminator Network: Building the discriminator network to distinguish between real and fake images.
6. Create Generator Network: Building the generator network to create new images.
7. Create Loss Function and Load Optimizers: Defining the loss function and setting up optimizers for training.
8. Create Training Loop to Train GAN: Implementing the training loop to train the GAN on the dataset.
